This project reached its purpose and thus archived.

# gw-articles

A small app to test a number of functionalities and structures. It fetches the main content of any articles available on [GUNSweek.com](https://gunsweek.com), parses it to markdown and then renders it on the client page.

Deployed on Cloudflare Pages via [Nuxt Hub](https://hub.nuxt.com).

### Features
- [x] dynamic pages
- [x] fetch page content server side
- [x] parse page content to markdown
- [x] render markdown to client page

### Disclaimer

I work with the GUNSweek team, its development and foundation.
The source code of this project is to both prove a point on the fact that whoever is interested in scraping the web could easily do it regardless of any configurations, as well as pointing out a number of enhancement to the GW project itself (discussed privately).

Any content rendered falls under the [GUNSweek's legal notice](https://gunsweek.com/en/about-us)
